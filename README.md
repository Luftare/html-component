# html-component
Compose static website from html components.

## What's the point?
- get most out of HTML, CSS and JS
- compose static website from components
- BEM powered single file components
- source code is production code 1:1
- client is responsible for building the site
- handlebars.js as the only (included) dependency

## Still, why?
Challenge some of the best-practises such as:
- http request count should be optimized
- page load time should be minimized
- SEO should be considered
- page should be reactiveÂ¨
- No style tags inside body

## Not impressed... How do you even use it?
(Clone the repo and host it as it is)
